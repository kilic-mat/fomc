# We examine the short-term impact of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements on technology stocks behavior. Using a modified continuous-time simulation model, we analyze high-frequency data for nine representative stocks from July # 2019 to January 2021, covering ten FOMC announcement dates and the outbreak of COVID-19. High-frequency data provides more insight than lower frequent data.
